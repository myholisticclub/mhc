<h3>Third Party Services.</h3>
<p>The Services may permit you to link to other websites, services or resources on the Internet, and other websites, services or resources may contain links to the Services. When you access third party resources on the Internet, you do so at your own risk. These other resources are not under our control, and you acknowledge that we are not responsible or liable for the content, functions, accuracy, legality, appropriateness or any other aspect of such websites or resources. The inclusion of any such link does not imply our endorsement or any association between us and their operators. You further acknowledge and agree that we shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with the use of or reliance on any such content, goods or services available on or through any such website or resource.</p>
<h3>Payments and Billing.</h3>
<p>1. Paid Services: Certain of our Services may be subject to payments now or in the future (the &ldquo;Paid Services&rdquo;). Please note that any payment terms presented to you in the process of using or signing up for a Paid Service are deemed part of this Agreement.</p>
<p>2. Billing: We use a third-party payment processor (the &ldquo;Payment Processor&rdquo;) to bill you through a payment account linked to your Account on the Services (your &ldquo;Billing Account&rdquo;) for use of the Paid Services. The processing of payments will be subject to the terms, conditions and privacy policies of the Payment Processor in addition to this Agreement. We are not responsible for error by the Payment Processor. By choosing to use Paid Services, you agree to pay us, through the Payment Processor, all charges at the prices then in effect for any use of such Paid Services in accordance with the applicable payment terms and you authorize us, through the Payment Processor, to charge your chosen payment provider (your &ldquo;Payment Method&rdquo;). You agree to make payment using that selected Payment Method. We reserve the right to correct any errors or mistakes that it makes even if it has already requested or received payment.</p>
<p>3. Payment Method: The terms of your payment will be based on your Payment Method and may be determined by agreements between you and the financial institution, credit card issuer or other provider of your chosen Payment Method. If we, through the Payment Processor, do not receive payment from you, you agree to pay all amounts due on your Billing Account upon demand.</p>
<p>4. Recurring Billing: Some of the paid services may consist of an initial period, for which there is a one-time charge, followed by recurring period charges as agreed to by you. By choosing a recurring payment plan, you acknowledge that such services have an initial and recurring payment feature and you accept responsibility for all recurring charges prior to cancellation. We may submit periodic charges (e.G., monthly) without further authorization from you, until you provide prior notice (receipt of which is confirmed by us) that you have terminated this authorization or wish to change your payment method. Such notice will not affect charges submitted before we reasonably could act. To terminate your authorization or change your payment method, login to your account and edit your billing information.</p>
<p>5. Current Information Required: You must provide current, complete and accurate information for your billing account. You must promptly update all information to keep your billing account current, complete and accurate (such as a change in billing address, credit card number, or credit card expiration date), and you must promptly notify us or our payment processor if your payment method is cancelled (e.G., for loss or theft) or if you become aware of a potential breach of security, such as the unauthorized disclosure or use of your user name or password. Changes to such information can be made at your account management page. If you fail to provide any of the foregoing information, you agree that we may continue charging you for any use of paid services under your billing account unless you have terminated your paid services as set forth above.</p>
<p>6. Change in Amount Authorized: If the amount to be charged to your Billing Account varies from the amount you preauthorized (other than due to the imposition or change in the amount of state sales taxes), you have the right to receive, and we shall provide, notice of the amount to be charged and the date of the charge before the scheduled date of the transaction. Any agreement you have with your payment provider will govern your use of your Payment Method. You agree that we may accumulate charges incurred and submit them as one or more aggregate charges during or at the end of each billing cycle.</p>
<p>7. Auto-Renewal for Subscription Services: Unless you opt out of auto-renewal, which can be done through your Account Settings, any Subscription Services you have signed up for will be automatically extended for successive renewal periods of the same duration as the subscription term originally selected, at the then-current non-promotional rate. To change or resign your Subscription Services at any time, go to Account Settings. If you terminate a Subscription Service, you may use your subscription until the end of your then-current term; your subscription will not be renewed after your then-current term expires. However, you won&rsquo;t be eligible for a prorated refund of any portion of the subscription fee paid for the then- current subscription period.</p>
<p>8. Reaffirmation of Authorization: Your non-termination or continued use of a Paid Service reaffirms that we are authorized to charge your Payment Method for that Paid Service. We may submit those charges for payment and you will be responsible for such charges. This does not waive our right to seek payment directly from you. Your charges may be payable in advance, in arrears, per usage, or as otherwise described when you initially selected to use the Paid Service.</p>
<p>9. Free Trials and Other Promotions: Any free trial or other promotion that provides access to a Paid Service must be used within the specified time of the trial. You must stop using a Paid Service before the end of the trial period in order to avoid being charged for that Paid Service. If you cancel prior to the end of the trial period and are inadvertently charged for a Paid Service, please contact us at cs@My Holistic Club.com.</p>
<h3>Termination</h3>
<p>We may terminate your access to all or any part of the Services at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice, effective immediately, which may result in the forfeiture and destruction of all information associated with your membership. If you wish to terminate your Account, you may do so by following the instructions on the Site or through the Services. Any fees paid hereunder are non- refundable. All provisions of these Terms of Service which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, licenses of User Content, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of liability.</p>
<h3>Terms of Sale.</h3>
<p>By purchasing any Services, including Offers, Deals, Discounts, Promotions, Offering, Product or participating in other available programs via the Site, you agree to the Terms of Use, including, without limitation, the Terms of Sale specified below.</p>

My Holistic Club does not investigate or vet Providers. My Holistic Club is also not responsible for any claims associated with the description of the Provider Offerings, Services, or Products. Pricing related to Provider Offerings, Products, Services, and other programs on the Site may change at any time at My Holistic Club&rsquo;s sole discretion without notice.</p>
<p>2. A Provider may advertise goods, services, or experiences on the Site, or with respect to Products, Services, or Offerings, supply items to My Holistic Club, that require Provider to have an up-to- date regulatory authorization, license, or certification. My Holistic Club does not verify, validate, or collect evidence of any regulatory authorization, license, or certification from any Provider. You should make whatever investigation you deem necessary and appropriate before purchase of any Service, Product, or Offerings. Providers are solely responsible for the Services, Products, or Offerings being provided or the care and quality of those items.</p>
<p>3. Gifts and Promotions: From time to time, we may make available gift cards for My Holistic Club membership, or other types of promotions or promotional plans. Promotions and promotional plans may be redeemed as described in the specifics of the promotion and may be subject to additional or different terms. Promotions and promotional plans are only available to new customers that have never had a My Holistic Club account before, are not transferable, can only be used once, cannot be combined with other offers, cannot be redeemed for cash, are void where prohibited, and may be subject to additional terms, conditions, and limitations.</p>
<p>4. Offers: Offers are redeemable for certain goods, services, or experiences offered by, or facilitated through, the Provider identified with the Offer. The Provider is solely responsible for redeeming the Offer and for the care and quality of all goods, services, and experiences it provides to you and for any and all injuries, illnesses, damages, claims, liabilities, and costs it may cause you to suffer, directly or indirectly, in full or in part, whether related to the use or redemption of an Offer or not. You waive and release My Holistic Club and its subsidiaries, affiliates, partners, officers, directors, employees, and agents from any liabilities arising from or related to any act or ommission of a Provider in connection with your use of a Offer, Activity, or the goods, services, or experiences a Provider provides</p>

We make no representations concerning any Content contained in or accessed through the Services, and we will not be responsible or liable for the accuracy, copyright compliance, or legality of material or Content contained in or accessed through the Services.</p>
<p>3. The services and content are provided &ldquo;as is&rdquo;, &ldquo;as available&rdquo; and without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of title, non- infringement, merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose, and any warranties implied by any course of performance or usage of trade, all of which are expressly disclaimed. We, and our directors, employees, agents, suppliers, partners and content providers do not warrant that: (I) the services will be secure or available at any particular time or location; (ii) any defects or errors will be corrected; (iii) any content or software available at or through the services is free of viruses or other harmful components; or (iv) the results of using the services will meet your requirements. Your use of the services is solely at your own risk.</p>
<h3>Indemnification</h3>
<p>You shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless us, our affiliates and each of our and their respective employees, contractors, directors, suppliers and representatives from all liabilities, claims, and expenses, including reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees, that arise from or relate to your use or misuse of, or access to, the Services, Content, or otherwise from your User Content, violation of these Terms of Service, or infringement by you, or any third party using your Account or identity in the Services, of any intellectual property or other right of any person or entity. We reserve the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you, in which event you will assist and cooperate with us in asserting any available defenses.</p>
<h3>Limitation of Liability</h3>
<p>In no event shall we, nor our directors, employees, agents, partners, suppliers or content providers, be liable under contract, tort, strict liability, negligence or any other legal or equitable theory with respect to the services (I) for any lost profits, data loss, cost of procurement of substitute goods or services, or special, indirect, incidental, punitive, compensatory or consequential damages of any kind whatsoever (however arising), (ii) for any bugs, viruses, trojan horses, or the like (regardless of the source of origination), or (iii) for any direct damages in excess of (in the aggregate) of the greater of (a) fees paid to us for the particular services during the immediately previous three (3) month period or (b) $500.00.</p>
<h3>Arbitration clause &amp; class action waiver &ndash; important &ndash; please review as this affects your legal rights</h3>
<p>1. Arbitration: You agree that all disputes between you and us (whether or not such dispute involves a third party) with regard to your relationship with us, including without limitation disputes related to these terms of service, your use of the services, and/or rights of privacy and/or publicity, will be resolved by binding, individual arbitration under the american arbitration association&rsquo;s rules for arbitration of consumer-related disputes and you and we hereby expressly waive trial by jury; provided, however, that to the extent that you have in any manner violated or threatened to violate our intellectual property rights, we may seek injunctive or other appropriate relief in any state or federal court in the state of new york. Discovery and rights to appeal in arbitration are generally more limited than in a lawsuit, and other rights that you and we would have in court may not be available in arbitration. As an alternative, you may bring your claim in your local &ldquo;small claims&rdquo; court, if permitted by that small claims court&rsquo;s rules and if within such court&rsquo;s jurisdiction, unless such action is transferred, removed or appealed to a different court. You may bring claims only on your own behalf. Neither you nor we will participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims covered by this agreement to arbitrate. You are giving up your right to participate as a class representative or class member on any class claim you may have against us including any right to class arbitration or any consolidation of individual arbitrations. You also agree not to participate in claims brought in a private attorney general or representative capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person&rsquo;s account, if we are a party to the proceeding. This dispute resolution provision will be governed by the federal arbitration act and not by any state law concerning arbitration. In the event the american arbitration association is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within one hundred and sixty (160) days of filing the case, then either we or you can elect to have the arbitration administered instead by the judicial arbitration and mediation services. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction. Any provision of applicable law notwithstanding, the arbitrator will not have authority to award damages, remedies or awards that conflict with these terms of service. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of, related to or connected with the use of the services or these terms of services must be filed within one (1) year after such claim of action arose or be forever banned.</p>
<p>2. Severability: If the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is found to be unenforceable, then all of the preceding language in this Arbitration section will be null and void. This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with us.</p>
<h3>Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h3>
<p>These Terms of Service shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, including its conflicts of law rules, and the United States of America. You agree that any dispute arising from or relating to the subject matter of these Terms of Service shall be governed by the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state and Federal courts of New York County, New York.</p>

We may also impose limits on certain features and services or restrict your access to parts or all of the Services without notice or liability. While we will timely provide notice of modifications, it is also your responsibility to check these Terms of Service periodically for changes. Your continued use of the Services following notification of any changes to these Terms of Service constitutes acceptance of those changes, which will apply to your continued use of the Services going forward. Your use of the Services is subject to the Terms of Service in effect at the time of such use.</p>
<p>1. Entire Agreement and Severability: These Terms of Service are the entire agreement between you and us with respect to the Services, including use of the Site, and supersede all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals (whether oral, written or electronic) between you and us with respect to the Services. If any provision of these Terms of Service is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that these Terms of Service will otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. The failure of either party to exercise in any respect any right provided for herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder</p>
